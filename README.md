A list of experiments to try with various open air and transformer cored electro magnetic coils

## Experiment 1

Wrap a flyback transformer core with equal number of turns on each side in solenoid fashion, about 15turns of 26g.
Attach a signal generator and Osciloscope to one coil, and the second Osciloscope channel to the second coil.
With a signal generator sweep through and pause when the amplitude is greater than the input coil, make notes of the frequency and continue sweeping making notes of frequency when this goes above or below the input amplitude.

It is expected to find more than one point at which this happens, this point is a resonant frequency dictated by the RLC of the circuit. Changing any of these RLC values will either shift the resonant frequency up or down.
